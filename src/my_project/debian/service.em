# Package names, as generated by bloom and trimmed here to 32 characters in
# length, are safe to use as user names. This assertion is supported by the
# following references:
#
# > Package names (both source and binary, see Package) must consist only of
# > lower case letters (a-z), digits (0-9), plus (+) and minus (-) signs, and
# > periods (.). They must be at least two characters long and must start with
# > an alphanumeric character.
#
# -- https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-source
#
# > It is usually recommended to only use usernames that begin with a lower
# > case letter or an underscore, followed by lower case letters, digits,
# > underscores, or dashes. They can end with a dollar sign. In regular
# > expression terms: [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$]?
#
# > On Debian, the only constraints are that usernames must neither start with
# > a dash ('-') nor plus ('+') nor tilde ('~') nor contain a colon (':'), a
# > comma (','), or a whitespace (space: ' ', end of line: '\n', tabulation:
# > '\t', etc.). Note that using a slash ('/') may break the default algorithm
# > for the definition of the user's home directory.
#
# > Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.
